#### Execution
You can open any of the notebooks using either Google Colab or a Jupyter Notebook. If you don't already have Jupyter Notebook or any previous python experience I heavily suggest you to use Google Colab (just click on the notebook link and then the "Open with Google Colaboratory" button above it).
You're gonna need the `matplotlib` library to execute it. It comes by default in the Google Collab setup. If you're running it locally i expect you to know.
