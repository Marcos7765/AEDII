In this case, by dividing O(N) by N we get O(N) / N = O(1) for each **list.append()**. We then say that **list.append()** has **amortized complexity** of O(1).\n","\n","In terms of execution time, having amortized complexity O(1) will yield the same results as if the complexity really was O(1).

If we need more complex operations, odds are that there is a more efficient data structure for storing the data.\n","\n","Looping over all list elements is not on the above table because it is not a list method. But it is efficient to do so since it takes O(N) to iterate over N elements in a list. No data structure can do this faster because, as we've learned. We cannot look at N values faster than O(N) since, inspecting a single memory location takes O(1).\n","\n","Let's do an experiment to see the difference between adding at the end of the list with **list.append()** and at the beginning with **list.insert()**.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cEYM3OXx__B9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Instructions**\n","\n","\n","Two functions are provided for you.

Since the size of numbers in Python can grow as large as the computer memory allows, we conclude that arithmetic operations cannot be performed in constant time in Python.\n","\n","Arithmetic operations are yet another common example of hidden function calls in Python. The code **x + y** in Python is a syntactic sugar for **x.__add__(y)**. The same is true for other arithmetic operations. For example, **x * y** corresponds to **x.__mul__(y)**. The time complexity of doing an arithmetic operation between two integers depends on the number of digits required to represent them.\n","\n","The exact time complexities are relatively complex and not very useful for data science as a whole.
